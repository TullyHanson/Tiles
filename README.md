# Tiles
Destroy the tiles before they reach the top!

Prototype of an Android mobile game developed in Unity. The mechanics are simple: Tiles are generated at the bottom of the screen and pushed upwards. Tapping a tile rotates it clockwise, and Tiles with the same color touching are destroyed.

For the most part, this version will no longer be developed. A better 2.5D version is in the works, with a tentative release date of Summer 2016 for Android and iOS.

# Goals
- [x] Simple playability testing to determine if it's an idea worth pursuing 
- [x] Familiarize myself with Unity mobile development
- [x] Determine best approach to a tile/grid based game

# To-Do:
- [ ] Add an adjacency check as Tiles are generated, and after they finish falling
- [ ] End condition, currently Tiles are generated infinitely
- [ ] Add value to block destruction and keep track of player score
